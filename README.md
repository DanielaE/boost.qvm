Quaternions, Vectors, Matrices library for Boost review

(Note: Boost QVM is not part of Boost. Please post questions and suggestions on the Boost Developers Mailing List).

Boost QVM defines a set of generic functions and operator overloads for working with quaternions, vectors and matrices of static size with the emphasis on 2, 3 and 4-dimensional operations needed in graphics, video games and simulation applications. While it provides its own quaternion, matrix and vector types, it is designed to work primarily with user-defined types through user specializations of the q_traits, v_traits and m_traits templates.

Complete documentation is available in libs/qvm/doc as well as online at http://zajo.github.io/boost-qvm/.
